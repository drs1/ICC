We create control flow graphs for every set of tac instructions by making each
instruction a basic block and adding the edges for jumps, etc.

We then perform Live Variable analysis by defining def and use functions for each block.
We use these to implement the transfer function for blocks in live variable analysis.

In reaching copies analysis, we use a map to store the source and destination operations
for each copy (instead of a set of tuples).  Every time we find a reassigned copy to a destination,
we remove it from the map and replace it with the new source.
